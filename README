This repository contains my personal Ansible roles.

**They do not intend to be generic and ready-to-use.**

However, fell free to read/use/extend them and to contact me if you have
any questions.

Please make sure you read and understand every role before running
it. Otherwise, you'll possibly loose something you love.

Ah, did anyone tell you already to always have recent backups?

* default target systems
    * apt-based
    * Debian(-based)
