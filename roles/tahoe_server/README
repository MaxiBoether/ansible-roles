Creates a Tahoe-LAFS client (i.e. part of the grid), started at boot.

(In p2p, an always-on client is basically a server)

It won't offer services by default.

This is a more abstract role because the node does nothing per default.
Therefore, it is probably useless to use this role directly.
Rather, use a role that is implicating this one (storage, wui etc.).
