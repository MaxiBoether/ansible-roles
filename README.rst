some Ansible roles
==================

This repository contains Ansible roles, mainly for Debian(-based)
systems.

The roles cover most of my administrative tasks and configurations
(which have to be fulfilled/applied more than once).

The roles are intended to be somewhat reusable,
but please do not apply them blindly.
Make sure you read and understand a role before running it.
Otherwise, you'll possibly loose something you love.

If you *do* run this roles, have recent backups.

Feel free to read/try/use/extend them
and to contact me if you have any questions.

The most intensively developed, used and maintained role is
``managed_host``.
You (should) find README files in the roles' directories.
There are also
`a few random notes on (intended) conventions <conventions.rst>`__.

Configuration files which are not used by these roles but maybe
interesting for others as well are kept in
`this repository <https://gitlab.com/lpirl/dotfiles>`__.
